This widget will let you display a list of the most recent posts in a single category in your sidebar.

== Description ==

Sure, WordPress has a widget for displaying your most recent posts, but what if you want to only display the posts from a single category in a widget, and not everything?  This plugin Widget lets you set the title, category, and quantity of posts to display, then it kicks out a list of the most recent posts in that category.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the file `widget_cat_posts.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Position the widget in the desired sidebar through the `widgets` admin page
1. Set the category and number of posts to display
