== ABOUT MAGAZINE PREMIUM ==

Create a truly unique design with Magazine Premium, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme based on the Gridiculous boilerplate. Use the new Theme Options customizer to add your own background, page layout, site width, link color and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress & BuddyPress. Built using Twitter Bootstrap and includes 20 Google Fonts for improved typeface readability. Works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/magazine-premium/.

== NOTES ==

* The home page sliders can only display a maximum of 10 slides if custom slides are added using the Slider admin page.
* Top level (parent) menu items should not be clickable, but instead should just be a group heading with "#" in the URL field. That way they will work correctly on touch enabled devices.
* If a left sidebar layout option is selected, the sidebar will go offcanvas on mobile devices and appear below the mobile menu when the top left icon is clicked.
